          <p className="mb-4">
            Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Corey Beaver</strong>, an Apostolic Pentecostal producer and worship musician based in Detroit, MI. I mainly play keys, including piano, organ, and auxiliary instruments, but I also play guitar and bass. My musical journey began as a classically trained trumpet player, performing in marching bands, symphonic bands, and jazz ensembles, which gave me a strong foundation in music theory and performance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            I am the main keys player for <strong>Ascend Church</strong> in Troy, MI, and have studied music for over 8 years. My production work is dedicated strictly to worship music across all styles, with a particular passion for Southern Gospel.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            My musical path was shaped by influential mentors, including <strong>Josh Kiser</strong>, who invited me to join the worship team at Ascend Church, <strong>Payton West</strong>, who gave me my first piano lesson, <strong>Dr Lindel Anderson</strong>, the former dean of Worship Studies at Indiana Bible College, and my pastor <strong>Joumeel Mclarine</strong>. My theological studies were inspired by <strong>Bobby Killmon</strong>, my Biblical Studies Dean at Indiana Bible College,  <strong>TJ Elkins</strong>, a minister at Ascend Church, and of course, my pastor. My parents,  <strong>John Beaver</strong> and  <strong>Crystal Beaver</strong> are the most important roles in my journey, having raised me in Apostolic Faith my entire life.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Beyond music, I am an apologist working on my book <strong>"Defending Oneness"</strong>. My study of apologetics and theology is deeply rooted in my faith and mentorship, aiming to provide clarity and defense of the Oneness Pentecostal doctrine through both teaching and writing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-indigo-600 font-semibold">
            My mission is to create worship music that moves people spiritually and to provide thoughtful, reasoned guidance in the study of faith.
